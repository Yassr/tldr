The security guard who approached Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel suite before the massacre said he heard "drilling sounds" before he was shot through the door.

In an episode of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" set to air Wednesday, Jesus Campos recounts for the first time on TV the night of the shooting.
Campos was wounded by Paddock on October 1, minutes before the gunman sprayed gunfire on concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a hotel room in the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort Casino.
Paddock killed 58 people and left nearly 500 concertgoers wounded. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.
More than two weeks after the attack, Campos said his health is improving.
"I'm doing better each day, slowly but surely. Just healing mentally and physically," he told DeGeneres.
